# Extended Ripleys K
Ripley's K function is originally applied to the second order analysis of stationary point process. It can be used to summarize a point pattern, test hypothesis about the pattern, estimate parameters and fit models. The relevance research has penetrated into bivaritate and multivariate generalizations, which provides effective methods to describe relationships between two or more point patterns.


An implementation of Ripley's K is provided here, which can be extended for bivariate and spatiotemporal pattern.

## Ripley's K
* Univariate Pattern
* Bivariate Pattern
* Spatiotemporal Pattern

## Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR)
* Homogeneous Possion Process
* Heterogenous Possion Process
* Cox Process
* Markov Process

## Hypothesis Testing
* Chi-Squared Test
* Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (K-S) Test
* Monte Carlo Simulation
